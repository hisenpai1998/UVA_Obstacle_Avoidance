# UAV Obstacle Avoidance

This project implements an **intelligent obstacle avoidance system** for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using **depth images** and simulation in **CoppeliaSim**.

> Fully written in Python  
> Real-time perception using RGB-D  
> Modular architecture for simulation, depth processing, collision detection, and navigation

## Project Goal

To enable a UAV to **autonomously avoid static and dynamic obstacles** using depth images and AI-based decision making.  
The system analyzes depth data from simulation, detects obstacles in real-time, and decides the best direction to avoid collisions.

---

## Core Features

- **Depth Image Processing** from RGB-D simulation
- **Obstacle Detection** with 9-region segmentation
- **Navigation Decision** (go left, right, or straight)
- **Simulation Integration** using CoppeliaSim API (ZMQ)
- **Modular Codebase** for extensibility and testing
